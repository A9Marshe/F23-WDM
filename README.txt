Good day Dr. Bassel,

The report is hosted online and can be accessed via this link:
https://f22-wdm-ali-242361.vercel.app/

The Jupyter notebook is also hosted on Google Colab and can be access via this link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bdrD8ed1mIpA0-avM7ry3gSaBpNEonRo?usp=sharing

To run the online colab Juypyter notebook we provided a kaggle.json with working API credentials.
Please import this file to Colab after connecting to a remote session. This way, you will be able to import data
from Kaggle directly from colab without the need to pre-download the data

all commands were orchestrated  in a chain of code blocks with relevant comments and informative text.

all findings were also exported to tabular forms and visual forms (charts) that can be inspected in the attached report.html file

Thanks in advance!
